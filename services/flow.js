    text: `üìñ **WHY TAKE THE TWELVE STEPS?**\n**(ADAPTED FROM THE DOCTORS OPINION chapter of the AA Big Book)**\n\nüåÄ Men and women take the Twelve Steps essentially because they like the effect produced by them.\n\nüß† The sensation is not so elusive that they admit it is helpful, and realize after a time that they can differentiate the true from the false.\n\nüå± To them, their recovered alcoholic life seems the only normal one.\n\nüòü If they stop taking the Steps, as so many do, they become restless, irritable, and discontented, unless they can again experience the sense of ease and comfort which comes at once by taking a few Steps--Steps they see others taking with success.\n\nüîÅ After they have succumbed to the desire to work the Steps again, and they pass through the well-known stages of recovery, emerging happy, with a firm resolution not to let their program slip away again.\n\nüîÑ This is repeated over and over, and as this person experiences an entire psychic change, there is every hope of his recovery.`,
